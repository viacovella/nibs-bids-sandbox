        "StimulationProcedure": "Electrical stimulation was delivered via two rubber electrodes inserted in saline-soaked sponges. The target electrode size was 5 x 5 cm while the return electrode size was 6 × 7 cm. Electrodes were kept in place with the use of elastic bands, which ensured a homogeneous pressure on the electrode surface and minimized the probability of drops in current density.",
